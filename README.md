# Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2024
This online repository stores my notes, cheatsheets, files, and homework assignments for the online course, Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2024, at [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/). 

This course is taken in *Cohort mode*, which enables participants to earn a certificate by timely completing and submitting the required course project(s) by certain deadlines. Additional benefits include homework submission for feedback, participation in online office hours to ask your questions, and access to bonus workshops and other online events organized for some cohorts.
